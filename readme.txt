Dear Reader,

this little Server/Client solution has been written for education purposes. 
You may use the whole or parts of it just as you wish,
for its source is totally open and free to use for everyone.

Although, there is one constraint: you must not copy my solution or
parts of it and declare it as your own work, when you are subscribed in the same course
as I am and also have to hand in this program.

Have fun with it.

New plugins must be stored in Server/Plugins

Regards,

bz
